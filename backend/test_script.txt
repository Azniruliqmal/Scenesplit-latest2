FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

JOHN sits at a table, reading a newspaper. The morning sun streams through the window, casting long shadows across the wooden floor.

JOHN
(looking up from his paper)
This is a test script for our integration test. It's designed to demonstrate the script analysis functionality.

SARAH enters the coffee shop, looking around nervously.

SARAH
(approaching John's table)
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

JOHN
(smiling warmly)
Not at all. Please, sit down.

SARAH sits down, placing her bag on the floor.

SARAH
Thank you. I'm Sarah.

JOHN
I'm John. Nice to meet you.

FADE OUT.

THE END
